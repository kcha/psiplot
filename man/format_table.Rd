\title{Format input event data}
\usage{
format_table(x, expr = FALSE, counts = FALSE, trim_colnames = NULL,
  short_ids = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame of event data as outputted by \code{vast-tools combine}.
e.g. each row is an event containing exon metadata, PSI and quality scores
values. If \code{expr = TRUE}, then each row is a gene containing two columns
of metadata, one column of cRPKM per sample, and, optionally, a second column
per sample with read counts.}

\item{expr}{Set to \code{TRUE} if formatting a cRPKM table. Otherwise,
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{counts}{Set to \code{TRUE} if the cRPKM table has read counts. Otherwise,
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{trim_colnames}{String that must be searched for and trimmed at the end
of every sample column in x. Useful to trim the "-cRPKM" suffix from expression
tables. If no string must be trimmed, leave as \code{FALSE}.}

\item{short_ids}{Set to \code{TRUE} to make the metadata column shorter in the
output, by including only the event ID (for events) or the gene ID (if run
with \code{expr==TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A data frame. If run with \code{expr=FALSE} (default), each row is an
event, the first column (\code{ID}) contains a concatenation of the event
metadata delimited by |, and there are two more columns per sample, with PSI
and quality scores values. If run with (\code{expr=TRUE}), each row is a gene,
the \code{ID} column contains the gene metadata, and there is one more column
per sample with the cRPKM value.
}
\description{
Convert low/bad quality PSI values and convert event metadata as a first ID
column. Prepares input event/GE data for plotting. Calls \code{\link{convert_psi}}.
}
\examples{
# For example input, see:
psi
format_table(psi)
# For cRPKM
crpkm
format_table(crpkm, expr = TRUE)

# For cRPKM with read counts and the "-cRPKM" suffix in sample columns:
crpkm_counts
format_table(crpkm_counts, expr = TRUE, counts = TRUE, trim_colnames = "-cRPKM")

# To keep only event IDs/gene IDs as metadata:
psi
format_table(psi,short_ids = TRUE)
