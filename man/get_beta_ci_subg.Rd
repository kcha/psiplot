\title{Calculate conficence intervals for error bars of subgrouped samples.}
\usage{
get_beta_ci_subg(q)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Data frame with quality scores of an event}
}
\description{
Helper function to filter and return confidence intervals based
on a joint beta distribution obtained from Q scores. For internal use.
}
\details{
Individual beta distributions are generated from each sample in the
subgroup. Those distributions are sampled and the results are used to fit a
new joint beta distribution. The joint beta is then sampled again to obtain
confidence intervals for the subgroup.
